## Details

For Christmas Day this year, we hosted my in-laws for the first time for a holiday brunch. In addition to the usual offerings of coffee and scrambled eggs, this year I decided to try my hand at from-scratch biscuits. 

These cheddar scallion biscuits are extremely decadent, wonderfully salty, and need nothing additional. Despite how heavy the recipe is, there were almost none left at the end of brunch!
