## Details

The pizza stone has for a while been elusive to me. My first few attempts at making pizza were tragedies and what was served more resembled soup than what I had promised my wife would be on the table.

Here's what I learned:

-   The oven must be at 500°F
-   The pizza stone must be in the oven at 500°F for an hour before placing a pizza on it
-   The pizza stone and wooden peel should seldom be washed, and if they are they should be stored in open air
    -   Regretfully we thought our stone was "dried" only to take it out of a dark cupboard to find it had mold!
-   The peel, dough, and stone should be generously coated with flour and/or corn meal

## Resources

-   [Valentino's Pizza Crust](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/6814/valentinos-pizza-crust/)
    -   Makes enough for two 12" pizza doughs, you can save one in the fridge for a week. Just be sure to let it come to room temperature before attempting the second one.
    -   I've tried a few dough recipes and this one comes out with the perfect consistency every time.
