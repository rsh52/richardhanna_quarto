## Details

While chicken parmesan may be the typical go-to, eggplant parm has a great flavor and is just as enjoyable. The texture is a bit softer and some prep goes in to drying out the eggplant ahead of time, but the end result is easily worth the wait.

This meal we paired with a side of risotto and homemade tomato sauce ("gravy" depending on if my wife is in ear shot).
