## Details

Koshari/koshary is the national dish of Egypt and an incredibly popular street food. The flavors of unparalleled, with a mix of tangy, spicy tomato sauce combined with bold, rich fried onions and made filling with chickpeas and lentils. It takes a bit of time and it's helpful to have a second pair of hands, but I highly recommend trying it out!
