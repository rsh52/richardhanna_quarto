## Details

Sushi has to be one of my favorite treats, typically we order it after a particularly long week. One of our holiday gifts this year was our own sushi making kit, including a "bazooka" instrument that helps roll and form the sushi roll before placing it on the rolling mat.

Unfortunately, for two people, we vastly overestimated the amount of fish we needed to buy for our sushi and wound up with way too much (worse problems though, am I right?). But for a first attempt, I'd say it was better than your typical grocery store sushi.
