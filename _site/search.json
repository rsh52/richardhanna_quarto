I joined CHOP about 5 years ago coming from a mechanical engineering background and about 4 years ago found my way into coding with R to solve problems, make products, you name it. Around that same time I met Stephan Kadauke who leads the DataOps team and helped found the R User Group and that more or less brings me in front of you today.\nAround the same time I started using R I was working with REDCap, and I found that the two go hand in hand rather well. Today I‚Äôm excited to talk to you about a package we‚Äôre developing that, for those of you also working with both R and REDCap, may hopefully become a useful tool to help your analytic processes.\nA quick shoutout also to Jake Riley. This is my first time doing a quarto presentation (quarto is the new rmarkdown) and he helped considerably with my frustrations over getting tables to render better in the slides. So thanks Jake!\n\nHuge shoutout to Jake Riley for helping troubleshoot quarto and kableExtra"

The web interface offers a secure, accessible way to architect databases of varying complexity at no cost to the institution for joining the REDCap consortium.\nYou can access REDCap on the web from anywhere, and it can store any data you can realistically imagine for research purposes. It is also attractive to research institutions for being capable of clearance for various compliance requirements.\nIn my opinion, REDCap is strongest in it‚Äôs front end UI ability to supply users with the tools to make databases quickly and with plenty of customization, but also provides complexity to those who wish to use it.\n\nFor participants of the REDCap consortium"

We have a record ID, and two ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù with underlying data. The first is a single sub-table or ‚Äúform‚Äù, while the second is stacked or ‚Äúrepeating.‚Äù We‚Äôll touch more on these shortly but they can be a bit cumbersome to work with.\nOn the right is a drilled-down display where the data gets entered. Here we see all of the Heroes Information associated with Record ID number 0. You can think of these as the column data elements tied to a single row for the hero A-Bomb.\nBecause of this, as mentioned earlier, REDCap can be about as complex as you want or need it to be."

First, an active REDCap database or project. Second, a REDCap API URI (in our case redcap.chop.edu/api/). Third an API token, since this is associated to your user rights you need to make sure you have the appropriate read/write privileges.\nLet‚Äôs assume I‚Äôve already done the work of preparing and importing this into a REDCap database so we can see what an export of the data looks like via REDCapR.\n\nSuch as https://redcap.chop.edu/api/Requires user API and Read/Write access"

Notice how the first row for record_id 0 has all of its hero information filled out, but the repeat variables are NA, and then for the remainder of record_id 0‚Äôs rows that behavior reverses.\nI want to call out a few things here, this is the way REDCap presents you with a raw database. It‚Äôs one massive table, not always the most intuitive, and perhaps not even what we originally expect. This can be very cognitively overloading and a barrier to getting started with working with your data. The introduction of repeating instruments, as shown here, further complicates this."

This can force analysts to go back and either recreate data they need or jump through hoops to make up for data sparsity.\nSecond: Data exports often wind up becoming much larger than anticipated because of how many rows get introduced, making exports messy and unwieldy.\nThird: Without an innate link to the metadata, it isn‚Äôt possible from the data export to determine what forms are linked to what instrument. This can be a problem in longitudinal studies when you want to reference variables that only appear in specific events.\nFourth: Row identification is confusing and inconsistent.

There are a number of things worth noting here:\n\nFirst in both of these tables we see there are no artificially generated NA artifact values.\nOn the left side, the non-repeating table shows that every record_id has a single row. On the right are repeating record_ids forming a compound key with the redcap_repeat_instance\nAdditionally, the redcap_repeat_ variables only appear in repeating sub tables.\nThis means that only the variables associated with the table will appear in it.\nThe presence of the primary key in the nonrepeating hero information table, and the compound key in the repeating hero powers table allows for easy joining.\n\nWhile this example REDCap only has two tables, most are going to have much more and it is very powerful to be able to join only the data you need and trust that the output contains all the relevant information."

Typically in a REDCap output you‚Äôll have a ‚Äúx_form_status_complete‚Äù indicating whether a form is complete, incomplete, or unverified.\nSince the name of the form is indicated in the super tibble, we have a single variable that doesn‚Äôt change name to indicate completeness. This can be helpful if, for example, you‚Äôre relying on only complete data for analysis or want to check on the progression of data entry in your project. The form_status_complete variable will always be located at the end of the dataframe."

Using the bind_tables helper function, we can take the table outputs of the redcap_data column from our TidieR output and place them directly into the global environment or any environment of our choosing.\nFor those of you who don‚Äôt know, environments are essentially a variant of lists in R. The most common one you probably work with is the global environment displayed in the panel of your RStudio IDE, but you can also make other environments to call from.\nFor this function, you can specify an environment to load to, the repeat/nonrepeat structure you‚Äôre interested in, and any specific tables. However, the default behavior with no arguments supplied will load directly to the global environment with all available objects."

Well don‚Äôt worry, because REDCapTidieR handles that too.\nIf you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, this table helps break down the three main archetypes of REDCap projects and their repeating/nonrepeating counterparts. There are ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù projects which have no longitudinal elements, i.e.¬†no events or arms. There are longitudinal projects with no arms, or 1 by default. And there are projects with many.\nWe‚Äôre already familiar with record_id and redcap_repeat_instance/instrument. What longitudinal events and arms add are these corresponding event and arm variables that further expand our compound keys. So what you see here are all of the required variables necessary to uniquely identify a row in a project type."

Records 1-3 appear in Arm1, events 1 and 2, but Record 4 is only Arm2, events 1 and 3.\nThe output of a read_redcap_tidy call is still the same.

    "text": "Stem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapeutic solution for cancers and other malignancies. During the process, a donor provides stem cells from their bone marrow which are separated from the blood using apheresis. Before the stem cells can be provided, the recipient must first have their blood-forming cells destroyed through chemotherapy so that both cancerous and non-cancerous cells are eliminated. The patient then receives the stem cells to replenish the lost cells and produce non-cancerous ones.\nThe key factor to monitor when undergoing this process is known as engraftment: the process when cells of interest re-emerge at appropriate count levels. In this case, we‚Äôre most interested in neutrophils (white blood cells responsible for fighting off infection) and platelets (responsible for blood clotting). We want the patient‚Äôs neutrophil level to reach a count of 500cells/uL and their platelet count to reach 20cells/uL.\nFor research staff, reporting these outcome values requires labor-intensive and error-prone calculations taken from multiple sources. By using the application, users need only supply a patient medical record number and receive all related transplants with easy to use buttons that copy the automated calculation directly to their clipboard for direct transcription into the data registry. This is further supported with interactive visuals for confirmation that the calculations are correct.\nAfter using the application for just a few months, research staff were able to correct numerous past entry errors as well as effectively eliminate prospective error reporting. Please feel free to watch the video recording to learn more!\n\n\n\nEngraftment App"

    "section": "",
    "text": "A PDF version of this abstract is available here\n\n\nProposal\nStem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapy for various malignant and non-malignant diseases. To aggregate real-world data on stem cell transplant patients, all cancer centers in the U.S. are required by law to report outcomes such as the time from transplant to the emergence of neutrophils and platelets, known as ‚Äúengraftment,‚Äù to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR).\nTraditionally, engraftment data is curated by data managers who manually look up information in medical records and complete web-based forms. This tedious manual process requires integration of multiple data sources and, at a top-tier pediatric cancer center, was found to have error rates as high as 28%.\nTo mitigate this problem, we developed an application that calculates engraftment dates automatically. We used the AMIA Usability Framework as a guide to create a minimalist and consistent design with informative and useful feedback and error messages. The Engraftment application passed clinical validation, and it is now in day-to-day use by our data managers, having eliminated the manual process. In a post-implementation validation, we found that the rate of incorrect engraftment dates reported to the CIBMTR had decreased to zero.\nIn this Systems Demonstration presentation, we will outline the clinical validation, production engineering, and operationalization of the Engraftment application. We will then demonstrate features built into the application that optimize usability and user experience. Finally, we will discuss how the application could be implemented at other cancer centers."

    "text": "Methods and Results\nChildren aged <18 years with cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation were studied. AMSA was calculated for 2 seconds before shock and averaged for each subject (AMSA‚Äêavg). TOF was defined as termination of ventricular fibrillation 10 seconds after defibrillation to any non‚Äêventricular fibrillation rhythm. ROSC was defined as >20 minutes without chest compressions. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses controlling for weight, current, and illness category were performed. Primary end points were TOF and ROSC. Secondary end points were 24‚Äêhour survival and survival to discharge. Between 2015 and 2019, 50 children from 14 hospitals with 111 shocks were identified. In univariate analyses AMSA was not associated with TOF and AMS‚ÄêAavg was not associated with ROSC. Multivariable logistic regression showed no association between AMSA and TOF but controlling for defibrillation average current and illness category, there was a trend to significant association between AMSA‚Äêavg and ROSC (odds ratio, 1.10 [1.00‚Äí1.22] P=0.058). There was no significant association between AMSA‚Äêavg and 24‚Äêhour survival or survival to hospital discharge."

    "text": "Background\nSurvival after paediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest is worse on nights and weekends without demonstration of disparity in cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality. It is unknown whether these findings differ in children with CHD. This study aimed to determine whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality might explain the hypothesised worse outcomes of children with CHD during nights and weekends.\n\n\nMethods\nIn-hospital cardiac arrest data collected by the Pediatric Resuscitation Quality Collaborative for children with CHD. Chest compression quality metrics and survival outcomes were compared between events that occurred during day versus night, and during weekday versus weekend using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nWe evaluated 3614 sixty-second epochs of chest compression data from 132 subjects between 2015 and 2020. There was no difference in chest compression quality metrics during day versus night or weekday versus weekend. Weekday versus weekend was associated with improved survival to hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio 4.56 [1.29,16.11]; p = 0.02] and survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 6.35 [1.36,29.6]; p = 0.02), but no difference with rate of return of spontaneous circulation or return of circulation. There was no difference in outcomes for day versus night.\n\n\nConclusion\nFor children with CHD and in-hospital cardiac arrest, there was no difference in chest compression quality metrics by time of day or day of week. Although there was no difference in outcomes for events during days versus nights, there was improved survival to hospital discharge and survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcome for events occurring on weekdays compared to weekends."

We compared chest compression (CC) rate, depth, and fraction (CCF) between the pre-transport and intra-transport periods.\n\n\nMethods\nObservational study of children <18 years with either in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who underwent transport between two care locations within the hospital for ECPR and who had CPR mechanics data available. Descriptive patient and arrest characteristics were summarized. The primary analysis compared pre- to intra-transport CC rate, depth, and fraction. A secondary analysis compared the proportion of pre- versus intra-transport 60-s epochs meeting guideline recommendations for rate (100-120/min), depth (‚â•4 cm for infants; ‚â•5 cm for children ‚â•1 year), and CCF (‚â•0.80).\n\n\nResults\nSeven patients (four IHCA; three witnessed OHCA) met eligibility criteria. Six (86%) patients survived the event and two (28%) survived to hospital discharge. Median transport CPR duration was 7 [IQR 5.5, 8.5] minutes. There were no differences in pre- vs.¬†intra-transport CC rate (115 [113, 118] vs.¬†118 [114, 127] CCs/minute; p = 0.18), depth (3.2 [2.7, 4.4] vs.¬†3.6 [2.5, 4.6] cm; p = 0.50), or CCF (0.89 [0.82, 0.90] vs.¬†0.92 [0.79, 0.97]; p = 0.31). Equivalent proportions of 60-s CPR epochs met guideline recommendations between pre- and intra-transport (rate: 66% vs.¬†57% [p = 0.22]; depth: 14% vs.¬†19% [p = 0.39]; CCF: 80% vs.¬†75% [p = 0.43]).\n\n\nConclusions\nPediatric CPR quality was maintained during intra-hospital patient transport, suggesting that it is reasonable for ECPR systems to incorporate patient transport to facilitate ECMO cannulation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nAutomotive interior design optimization must balance the design of the vehicle seat and occupant space for safety, comfort and aesthetics with the accommodation of add-on restraint products such as child restraint systems (CRS). It is important to understand the range of CRS dimensions so that this balance can be successfully negotiated. CRS design is constantly changing. In particular, the introduction of side impact protection for CRS as well as emphasis on ease of CRS installation has likely changed key design points of many child restraints. This ever-changing target creates a challenge for vehicle manufacturers to assure their vehicle seats and occupant spaces are compatible with the range of CRS on the market. To date, there is no accepted method for quantifying the geometry of child seats such that new designs can be catalogued in a simple, straightforward way. In this project, we propose to quantify the geometry of a selection of CRSs currently on the market and develop an easily implementable method to continue to collect this data as new CRSs become available.\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) data was collected for 40 CRS models (Rear-facing infant seats, convertible, and combination CRS). These 40 models represent 72 CRS models on the US market as of April 2013. Twenty-two CRS were scanned and digitized using a novel approach with the Microsoft Kinect Sensor. The scans were converted into surface models and finite element (FE) models using Hypermesh 12.0 (Altair Inc., MI). CRS manufacturers provided digital drawings of 18 additional CRS. The scans and digital drawings were overlapped at typical seat angles from literature data to create virtual surrogates.\nThe use of virtual surrogates by vehicle manufacturers in the design and development of the rear-seat vehicle environment early on in the design-development cycle has the potential to facilitate improved CRS-vehicle fitment."
