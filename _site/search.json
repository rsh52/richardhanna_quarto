When possible, my wife and I like to take hikes, ride out bikes, and explore the world around us.\nAt home I greatly enjoy cooking and baking. To me, culinary creations in the kitchen have a lot in common with engineering: design, precision, and gratification from a well-made (and hopefully tasty) product. When I feel up to being a bit more artistic, I also enjoy drawing and photography. This site will also serve to showcase some of these hobbies."

I joined CHOP about 5 years ago coming from a mechanical engineering background and about 4 years ago found my way into coding with R to solve problems, make products, you name it. Around that same time I met Stephan Kadauke who leads the DataOps team and helped found the R User Group and that more or less brings me in front of you today.\nAround the same time I started using R I was working with REDCap, and I found that the two go hand in hand rather well. Today I’m excited to talk to you about a package we’re developing that, for those of you also working with both R and REDCap, may hopefully become a useful tool to help your analytic processes.\nA quick shoutout also to Jake Riley. This is my first time doing a quarto presentation (quarto is the new rmarkdown) and he helped considerably with my frustrations over getting tables to render better in the slides. So thanks Jake!\n\nHuge shoutout to Jake Riley for helping troubleshoot quarto and kableExtra"

The web interface offers a secure, accessible way to architect databases of varying complexity at no cost to the institution for joining the REDCap consortium.\nYou can access REDCap on the web from anywhere, and it can store any data you can realistically imagine for research purposes. It is also attractive to research institutions for being capable of clearance for various compliance requirements.\nIn my opinion, REDCap is strongest in it’s front end UI ability to supply users with the tools to make databases quickly and with plenty of customization, but also provides complexity to those who wish to use it.\n\nFor participants of the REDCap consortium"

We have a record ID, and two “instruments” with underlying data. The first is a single sub-table or “form”, while the second is stacked or “repeating.” We’ll touch more on these shortly but they can be a bit cumbersome to work with.\nOn the right is a drilled-down display where the data gets entered. Here we see all of the Heroes Information associated with Record ID number 0. You can think of these as the column data elements tied to a single row for the hero A-Bomb.\nBecause of this, as mentioned earlier, REDCap can be about as complex as you want or need it to be."

If we all stand on the shoulders of giants, then REDCapR is the giant that REDCapTidieR has to thank.\nTo get started with API calls through these packages, you need a couple of things. First, an active REDCap database or project. Second, a REDCap API URI (in our case redcap.chop.edu/api/). Third an API token, since this is associated to your user rights you need to make sure you have the appropriate read/write privileges.\nLet’s assume I’ve already done the work of preparing and importing this into a REDCap database so we can see what an export of the data looks like via REDCapR.\n\nSuch as https://redcap.chop.edu/api/Requires user API and Read/Write access"

Now we can see how all of the NA’s trade off with the redcap_repeat_* variables. Notice how the first row for record_id 0 has all of its hero information filled out, but the repeat variables are NA, and then for the remainder of record_id 0’s rows that behavior reverses.\nI want to call out a few things here, this is the way REDCap presents you with a raw database. It’s one massive table, not always the most intuitive, and perhaps not even what we originally expect. This can be very cognitively overloading and a barrier to getting started with working with your data. The introduction of repeating instruments, as shown here, further complicates this."

    "text": "The Problem\n\nEmpty data introduced as an artifact of repeating instruments\nData export is often times large and unwieldy\nMissing metadata linking field association to instruments\nRow identification is confusing and inconsistent\n\n\n\nThere are a number of problems with this which anyone here who has worked with repeating instruments or longitudinal REDCap projects has probably run into.\nFirst: empty data shown by all those NA values is not actually indicative of missingness, instead this is an artifact introduced as a side effect of having these compound keys tied to repeating instruments. This can force analysts to go back and either recreate data they need or jump through hoops to make up for data sparsity.\nSecond: Data exports often wind up becoming much larger than anticipated because of how many rows get introduced, making exports messy and unwieldy.\nThird: Without an innate link to the metadata, it isn’t possible from the data export to determine what forms are linked to what instrument. This can be a problem in longitudinal studies when you want to reference variables that only appear in specific events.\nFourth: Row identification is confusing and inconsistent. As we saw, compound keys make for variable row identifiers that may or may not contain all of the data analysts need."

On the right are repeating record_ids forming a compound key with the redcap_repeat_instance\nAdditionally, the redcap_repeat_ variables only appear in repeating sub tables.\nThis means that only the variables associated with the table will appear in it.\nThe presence of the primary key in the nonrepeating hero information table, and the compound key in the repeating hero powers table allows for easy joining.\n\nWhile this example REDCap only has two tables, most are going to have much more and it is very powerful to be able to join only the data you need and trust that the output contains all the relevant information."

Typically in a REDCap output you’ll have a “x_form_status_complete” indicating whether a form is complete, incomplete, or unverified.\nSince the name of the form is indicated in the super tibble, we have a single variable that doesn’t change name to indicate completeness. This can be helpful if, for example, you’re relying on only complete data for analysis or want to check on the progression of data entry in your project.

There are “Classic” projects which have no longitudinal elements, i.e. no events or arms. There are longitudinal projects with no arms, or 1 by default. And there are projects with many.\nWe’re already familiar with record_id and redcap_repeat_instance/instrument.

You can learn more on our pkgdown and install the package yourself on our public GitHub repo, just be aware it is still in early development."

We want to extend accessibility and compatibility to include appropriate handling of raw data elements as well as labels depending on user specification. Right now the default is to only export raw data, but this is high on our priority list to fix.\nWe will be adding a few extraction functions to allow for tables to be extracted direct to the console or for variable assignment like you typically would expect so you don’t have to just use environments and binding.\nAnd lastly, hopefully we’ll get this accepted to CRAN! Would be pretty neat and my first CRAN package if possible so stay tuned!"

    "text": "Stem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapeutic solution for cancers and other malignancies. During the process, a donor provides stem cells from their bone marrow which are separated from the blood using apheresis. Before the stem cells can be provided, the recipient must first have their blood-forming cells destroyed through chemotherapy so that both cancerous and non-cancerous cells are eliminated. The patient then receives the stem cells to replenish the lost cells and produce non-cancerous ones.\nThe key factor to monitor when undergoing this process is known as engraftment: the process when cells of interest re-emerge at appropriate count levels. In this case, we’re most interested in neutrophils (white blood cells responsible for fighting off infection) and platelets (responsible for blood clotting). We want the patient’s neutrophil level to reach a count of 500cells/uL and their platelet count to reach 20cells/uL.\nFor research staff, reporting these outcome values requires labor-intensive and error-prone calculations taken from multiple sources. By using the application, users need only supply a patient medical record number and receive all related transplants with easy to use buttons that copy the automated calculation directly to their clipboard for direct transcription into the data registry. This is further supported with interactive visuals for confirmation that the calculations are correct.\nAfter using the application for just a few months, research staff were able to correct numerous past entry errors as well as effectively eliminate prospective error reporting.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Proposal\nStem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapy for various malignant and non-malignant diseases. To aggregate real-world data on stem cell transplant patients, all cancer centers in the U.S. are required by law to report outcomes such as the time from transplant to the emergence of neutrophils and platelets, known as “engraftment,” to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR).\nTraditionally, engraftment data is curated by data managers who manually look up information in medical records and complete web-based forms. This tedious manual process requires integration of multiple data sources and, at a top-tier pediatric cancer center, was found to have error rates as high as 28%.\nTo mitigate this problem, we developed an application that calculates engraftment dates automatically. We used the AMIA Usability Framework as a guide to create a minimalist and consistent design with informative and useful feedback and error messages. The Engraftment application passed clinical validation, and it is now in day-to-day use by our data managers, having eliminated the manual process. In a post-implementation validation, we found that the rate of incorrect engraftment dates reported to the CIBMTR had decreased to zero.\nIn this Systems Demonstration presentation, we will outline the clinical validation, production engineering, and operationalization of the Engraftment application. We will then demonstrate features built into the application that optimize usability and user experience. Finally, we will discuss how the application could be implemented at other cancer centers."

Secondary end points were 24‐hour survival and survival to discharge. Between 2015 and 2019, 50 children from 14 hospitals with 111 shocks were identified. In univariate analyses AMSA was not associated with TOF and AMS‐Aavg was not associated with ROSC. Multivariable logistic regression showed no association between AMSA and TOF but controlling for defibrillation average current and illness category, there was a trend to significant association between AMSA‐avg and ROSC (odds ratio, 1.10 [1.00‒1.22] P=0.058).

    "text": "As modern medicine increasingly pushes for predictive, prospective action over retrospective response the need for diagnostic devices has become ever more prevalent. This senior design project, developed at Drexel University, looked to produce a device which could employ the theory of Couette flow to measure human blood viscosity. The idea being that blood viscosity can provide strong clinical indications about a person’s health, but producing a device that is inexpensive, fast, and accurate would prove challenging.\nCouette flow involves three main components: a stationary outer cylinder, a rotational inner cylinder, and the fluid trapped between for analysis. Viscosity can be obtained by analyzing the rotational speed of the inner cylinder due to material properties of the test fluid and shear stresses imposed upon it.\n\n\n\nCouette Flow Diagram\n\n\nIn order to minimize costs and provide a device that could be easily incorporated in a hospital environment, the device (which we coined the “Haemopoise”) would act as a stand-alone system and housing capable of interfacing with existing vacutainer technologies. See the image below on what a vacutainer looks like:\n\n\n\nExample Vacutainer\n\n\nI highly encourage checking out the slide deck and report in the links above this page, but I will give a brief summary of how the device works:\n\nBlood is drawn from a patient into the vacutainer.\nThe vacutainer is placed in the receptacle of the Haemopoise device. The vacutainer acts as the outer rotational cylinder for Couette flow.\nAn OEM insert is placed inside of the vacutainer. The insert is a light, buoyant, disposable column which acts as the inner rotational cylinder for Couette flow.\nOn top of the insert is a reflective marker. A component of the insert contains aluminum for interaction with the Eddy current produced by rotational magnets.\nThe Eddy current induced rotation of the inner cylinder while a laser reads the rotational speed of the reflective surface at the top of the insert.\nThis rotational speed correlates with viscosity of the analyzed fluid (blood).\n\nCheck out this link for a demo on the Haemopoise in action (with a real human blood sample): Haemopoise Demo\nI couldn’t very well discuss this project without giving credit to my fantastic team: Michael Sinisi, Dan Nguyen, Austin Farber, and Matt Lorenz under the tutelage and supervision of Dr. Young Cho, PhD."

A secondary analysis compared the proportion of pre- versus intra-transport 60-s epochs meeting guideline recommendations for rate (100-120/min), depth (≥4 cm for infants; ≥5 cm for children ≥1 year), and CCF (≥0.80).\n\n\nResults\nSeven patients (four IHCA; three witnessed OHCA) met eligibility criteria.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nAutomotive interior design optimization must balance the design of the vehicle seat and occupant space for safety, comfort and aesthetics with the accommodation of add-on restraint products such as child restraint systems (CRS). It is important to understand the range of CRS dimensions so that this balance can be successfully negotiated. CRS design is constantly changing. In particular, the introduction of side impact protection for CRS as well as emphasis on ease of CRS installation has likely changed key design points of many child restraints. This ever-changing target creates a challenge for vehicle manufacturers to assure their vehicle seats and occupant spaces are compatible with the range of CRS on the market. To date, there is no accepted method for quantifying the geometry of child seats such that new designs can be catalogued in a simple, straightforward way. In this project, we propose to quantify the geometry of a selection of CRSs currently on the market and develop an easily implementable method to continue to collect this data as new CRSs become available.\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) data was collected for 40 CRS models (Rear-facing infant seats, convertible, and combination CRS). These 40 models represent 72 CRS models on the US market as of April 2013. Twenty-two CRS were scanned and digitized using a novel approach with the Microsoft Kinect Sensor. The scans were converted into surface models and finite element (FE) models using Hypermesh 12.0 (Altair Inc., MI). CRS manufacturers provided digital drawings of 18 additional CRS. The scans and digital drawings were overlapped at typical seat angles from literature data to create virtual surrogates.\nThe use of virtual surrogates by vehicle manufacturers in the design and development of the rear-seat vehicle environment early on in the design-development cycle has the potential to facilitate improved CRS-vehicle fitment."

All study sites videorecord and review resuscitations and use a pressure sensor/monitor device during CPR. All events where chest compressions (CC) were performed under videorecorded conditions with the monitor device in use were eligible for inclusion. Events where real-time feedback from monitoring devices for CC was available were excluded (ages > 8). Data on CPR performance was collected by a combination of video review and monitor device; CC rate and depth and ventilation rate were extracted in time periods corresponding to individual CPR providers. Data on verbal prompts (time, who gave prompts, what prompt consisted of) were identified during video review.\n\n\n\nThere were 21 cases with total 182 providers included in database during study periods (infants: n=15, children: n=6). Verbal prompts for compression rate and depth were given in 14/21 (67%) of cases. 19/80 (24%) came from the resuscitation leader; 32/80 (40%) and from a CPR coach. 7 (3.9%) providers doing CC watched ZOLL monitor for feedback. Appropriate verbal prompts for CC rate were given to 4.2 % of providers in infants and 8.8 % in children (p=0.024). And 9.2% in infants and 10.5 % in children (p=0.064) were given to providers for CC depth. After adjusting by confounders, there weren’t any significant differences between age groups for both CC rate: OR1.22 (95%CI 0.49-3.05, P=0.670) and depth: OR 2.82 (95%CI 0.73-10.9, P=0.134).\n\n\n\nVerbal prompts frequency for CC rate and depth during pediatric CPR was described.

Data on CPR performance was collected longitundinally during quarterly retraining sessions; scores were analyzed between quarter 1 and quarter 4 by nonparametric methods. Data on CPR performance during actual patient events was collected by simultaneous combination of video review and compression monitor devices to allow measurement of CPR quality by individual providers; linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the association between RQI components and CPR quality.\n\n\n\n159 providers completed four consecutive RQI sessions. Scores for all CPR tasks during retraining sessions significantly improved during the study period. 28 actual CPR events were captured during the study period; 49 observations of RQI trained providers performing CPR on children were analyzed. A significant association was found between the number of prior RQI sessions and the percent of compressions meeting guidelines for rate (β coefficient -0.08; standard error 0.04; p = 0.03).\n\n\n\nOver a 15 month period, RQI resulted in improved performance during training sessions for all skills. A significant association was found between number of sessions and adherence to compression rate guidelines during real patient events. Fewer than 30% of providers performed CPR on a patient during the study period. Multicenter studies over longer time periods should be undertaken to overcome the limitation of these rare events."
