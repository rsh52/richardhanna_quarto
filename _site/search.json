Thank you for joining me today, my name is Rich Hanna and I am a data scientist in the Cell & Gene Therapy Data Operations team. For those of you listening in or may not be able to see me, that‚Äôs me so you can place a face to the voice. I joined CHOP about 5 years ago coming from a mechanical engineering background and about 4 years ago found my way into coding with R to solve problems, make products, you name it. Around that same time I met Stephan Kadauke who leads the DataOps team and helped found the R User Group and that more or less brings me in front of you today.\nAround the same time I started R I was working with REDCap, and I found that the two go hand in hand rather well. Today I‚Äôm excited to talk to you about a package we‚Äôre developing that, for those of you also working with both R and REDCap, may hopefully become a useful tool to help your data analytics processes."

The web interface offers a secure, accessible way to architect databases of varying complexity at no cost to the institution for joining the REDCap consortium.\nYou can access REDCap on the web from anywhere, and it can store any data you can realistically imagine for research purposes. It is also attractive to research institutions for being capable of clearance for various compliance requirements.\nIn my opinion, REDCap is strongest in it‚Äôs front end UI ability to supply users with the tools to make databases quickly and with plenty of customization, but also provides complexity to those who wish to use it.\n\nFor participants of the REDCap consortium"

We have a record ID, and two ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù with underlying data. The first is a single sub-table or ‚Äúform‚Äù, while the second is stacked or ‚Äúrepeating.‚Äù\nOn the right is a drilled-down display where the data gets entered. Here we see all of the Heroes Information associated with Record ID number 0. You can think of these as the column data elements tied to a single row for the hero A-Bomb."

We will be using open source super hero data from SuperHeroDB, delivered via Kaggle. There are two CSV tables available where one contains Hero Information like name, height, weight, eye color, etc. and the other contains a wide table of hero name to a boolean of power name.\nLet‚Äôs assume I‚Äôve already done the work of preparing and importing this into a REDCap database so we can see what an export of the data looks like via REDCapR."

Now we can notice how all of the NA‚Äôs trade off with the redcap_repeat_* variables. Notice how the first row for record_id 0 has all of its hero information filled out, but the repeat variables are NA, and then for the remainder of record_id 0‚Äôs rows that behavior reverses."

    "text": "Data Scientist in CGT DataOps\n5 years at CHOP\nEngineering background\nTwo fuzzy coworkers\nTrying to implement quarto today\n\n\n\n\nHi everyone! Thank you for joining me today, my name is Rich Hanna and I am a data scientist in the Cell & Gene Therapy Data Operations team. For those of you listening in or may not be able to see me, that‚Äôs me so you can place a face to the voice. I joined CHOP about 5 years ago coming from a mechanical engineering background and about 4 years ago found my way into coding with R to solve problems, make products, you name it. Around that same time I met Stephan Kadauke who leads the DataOps team and helped found the R User Group and that more or less brings me in front of you today.\nAround the same time I started R I was working with REDCap, and I found that the two go hand in hand rather well. Today I‚Äôm excited to talk to you about a package we‚Äôre developing that, for those of you also working with both R and REDCap, may hopefully become a useful tool to help your data analytics processes."
